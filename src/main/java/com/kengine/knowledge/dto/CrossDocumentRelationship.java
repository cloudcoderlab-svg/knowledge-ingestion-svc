 * Represents a relationship discovered between entities across different documents.
 *
 * <p>Cross-document relationships are identified during the consolidation phase by analyzing
 * multiple document summaries and their metadata to find meaningful connections between entities
 * (components, workflows, business rules, etc.) that span across file boundaries.
 *
 * <p><strong>Example Relationships:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Workflow A in document1.xml triggers Business Rule B in document2.xml
 *   <li>Component X in file1.xml depends on Component Y in file2.xml
 *   <li>Domain A in config1.xml shares data model with Domain B in config2.xml
